- Learn to implement **responsive and user-friendly UI/UX**  
- Practice **component-based frontend architecture**  
- Understand how to **structure complex applications**  
- Develop collaboration skills by working in a team with defined roles  
- Apply **best practices** in version control, testing, and documentation  

## Tech Stack
**Frontend**:  
- HTML, CSS, JavaScript  
- React (or a similar framework)  

**Design & Planning**:  
- Figma (UI/UX Design)  

**Version Control**:  
- Git & GitHub  

## Core Features
- Property search and filtering  
- Property listing and details view  
- User authentication (login/signup)  
- Secure checkout and booking flow  
- Fully responsive design  
- Accessibility support following WCAG guidelines  

## Project Structure
- **UI Components**: Navbar, Property Card, Footer, Booking Form  
- **Primary Pages**: Property Listing View, Listing Detail View, Checkout View  

## Learning Objectives
By completing this project, you will:  
- Strengthen your frontend and backend development skills  
- Gain experience in **team-based agile development**  
- Practice writing **clean, modular, and reusable code**  
- Learn to document, test, and deploy a full-stack project

## UI/UX Design Planning

### Design Goals
- Create an intuitive and seamless booking flow  
- Maintain visual consistency across all pages  
- Ensure fast loading times for a smooth user experience  
- Prioritize mobile-first responsive design  

### Key Features
- Property search and filtering  
- Detailed property viewing with images and descriptions  
- Secure checkout process with payment confirmation  
- User authentication for personalized experiences  

### Primary Pages

| Page                   | Description                                                                 |
|-------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Property Listing View** | Displays a grid of available properties with filters for price, location, and ratings. |
| **Listing Detailed View** | Shows complete property details including images, amenities, reviews, and booking form. |
| **Simple Checkout View**  | Provides a streamlined payment flow and booking confirmation.              |

### Importance of User-Friendly Design
A well-designed booking system reduces friction in the user journey, leading to higher engagement and conversions. Clear navigation, intuitive interfaces, and responsive layouts improve customer satisfaction. By focusing on accessibility and simplicity, users can browse, select, and book accommodations without unnecessary complexity.

### Design Styles from Figma

**Color Styles**
- Primary: `#FF5A5F`  
- Secondary: `#008489`  
- Background: `#FFFFFF`  
- Text: `#222222`  
- Secondary Text: `#717171`  

**Typography**
- Font Family: Circular  
- Headings: Bold (700), `24px–32px`  
- Primary Text: Medium (500), `16px`  
- Secondary Text: Book (400), `14px`

### Why Identifying Design Properties Matters
Extracting color styles and typography details from your mockups ensures visual consistency, supports scalable development, and makes collaborating across design and code much more efficient. When you know exactly which colors, weights, and sizes to use, you avoid guesswork—your styling stays accurate and on point, every time.

## UI Component Patterns

To maintain consistency and reusability across the application, we will use modular UI components. These components can be combined and extended to build different pages while keeping a unified design system.

### Planned Components

- **Navbar**  
  Provides site-wide navigation with links to key pages (Property Listings, Checkout, Profile). Includes branding, search functionality, and responsive design for mobile.

- **Property Card**  
  Displays individual property details such as images, title, location, price per night, and rating. Acts as the primary building block for the Property Listing View.

- **Footer**  
  Contains essential links (Help, About, Contact, Terms & Privacy). Reinforces branding and provides quick access to secondary navigation.
  
By creating standardized UI components, we ensure scalability, maintainability, and a consistent user experience across the booking system.
